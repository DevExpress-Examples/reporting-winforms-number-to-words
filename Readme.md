# Reporting for WinForms - Number to Words Conversion in a Report


In this example, the calculated field's [GetValue](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.UI.CalculatedField.GetValue) event is handled to convert numbers to words. Generally, you can handle the [BeforePrint](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.UI.XRControl.BeforePrint) or [PrintOnPage](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.UI.XRControl.PrintOnPage) event handler) events.

A number is translated to a word by retrieving a word from a custom number-word dictionary.

If you're an owner of the [Universal](https://www.devexpress.com/subscriptions/universal.xml) or [Office File API subscription](https://www.devexpress.com/products/net/office-file-api/),Â you can use our built-in [NumberInWords](https://documentation.devexpress.com/#DocumentServer/clsDevExpressDocsTextNumberInWordstopic)Â class to convert numbers to words.
